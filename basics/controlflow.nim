# If statements works similar to python
if 10 > 6:
    echo "10 is greater than 6"
elif 10 < 10:
    echo "Something is wrong"
else:
    echo "Something is world with the world then"

# case is like switch in other languages
const x: int8 = 10
case x
of 5:
    echo "5"
of 7:
    echo "7"
of 10:
    echo "10"
else: discard
